ChromaPick is a tool that allows users to quickly and easily select and copy a color from a web page or image. Typically, the extension adds a small button to the user's web browser, which can be clicked to activate the color picker. Once activated, the user can hover their cursor over any element on the page and the extension will display the color code for that element. The user can then copy the code to their clipboard and use it in their own designs or projects.
